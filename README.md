# English translation of the Kovalevskaya Top paper

This repo contains the latex and PDF of an English translation and digitisation of the classic Kovalevskaya Top paper by Sofya Kovalevskaya (aka Sophie Kowalevski).

## Translation methodology

This paper was produced by uploading the scanned original French PDF to an Anthropic Claude project to produce a first pass latex version. That version was then downloaded and edited in Visual Studio Code using the `Latex Workshop` plugin and a full latex installation. Claude Code was used in VS code to assist with further AI edits. Alas, a considerable amount of manual editing was still required. All equations and equation numbers were then reviewed one by one by flicking between two PDFs. The English then received minor manual rephrasing to make it coherent. All in all it took about three days.
